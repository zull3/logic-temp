# Logic - Temperature

## Instructions  
The temperature task that was previously structured and to some extent implemented must now be clearly implemented. The basic structure is represented as shown in Main.java

Code under the headings "declaration of variables", "start" and "print" you have already made in the previous unit/momet. Now fill in the code under the heading "processing".
